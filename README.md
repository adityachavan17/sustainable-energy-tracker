# Sustainable Energy Tracker  

## 1. Project Overview  
Sustainable Energy Tracker is a web-based application designed to visualize energy consumption trends for India. It uses a dataset to analyze and display primary energy consumption per capita over time, providing insights and recommendations for sustainable energy usage.

## 2. Features  
1. Energy Consumption Visualization: Displays a line chart of per capita energy usage in India.  
2. Data-Driven Insights: Provides sustainability tips based on historical energy usage trends.  
3. Interactive Web App: Built using Flask and Matplotlib, making data accessible via a simple web interface.  

## 3. Tech Stack  
1. Frontend: HTML  
2. Backend: Python (Flask)  
3. Data Processing: Pandas  
4. Visualization: Matplotlib  



## 4. How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Sustainable-Energy-Tracker.git  
   cd Sustainable-Energy-Tracker  
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install flask pandas matplotlib  
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```sh
   python app.py  
   ```
4. Access the application:  
   Open a browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000  
   ```

## 5. Dataset  
The project uses `energy_data.csv`, which contains historical energy consumption per capita for multiple countries. The app filters data specifically for **India**.

## 6. Sustainability Tips  
1. Use LED bulbs to save electricity.  
2. Unplug unused devices to reduce power wastage.  
3. Optimize energy consumption based on trends shown in the graph.  

## 7. Hackathon Participation  
This project was developed for **Hackoverflow 8.0**, the official software hackathon of **Aarohan 2025, NIT Durgapur**.
